# QuadraticEquationsWithRisc-V
A program for solving quadratic equations using Risc-V made to serve as the final project for Processor Architectures course

The program can be simulated here: https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3410/2019sp/riscv/interpreter/#

The program can solve quadratic equations that have answers which are not complex.
Do note that all the values during calculation are stored as integers which can in some cases alter the final answer
This ISA version of Risc-V does not contain instructions for division and multipication so everything is calculated using add, sub and branching instructions.
