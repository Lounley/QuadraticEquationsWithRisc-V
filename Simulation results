case1
a = -3
b = 10
c = -3

High level result: 0.333, 3
Low level result:  0, 3
Analysis: Low level implementation only stores values as integers so 0.333 -> 0


case2
a = 5
b = -3
c = 2

High level result: no answer ( answer is complex ) 
Low level result:  no answer ( answer is complex )
Analysis: Both implementations were able to determine that the answer is complex and didn’t give an answer as they don’t calculate complex answers


case3
a = 6
b = 8
c = -2

High level result: 0.21525, -1.54858
Low level result:  0, 1
Analysis: same as case1
